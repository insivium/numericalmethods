This repository concerns snippets of code encompassing a standard numerical analysis course.

Many of these codes came out of quite a few insightful conversations with my numerical analysis professor.
I hope you will put them to good use.

P.S Note that there are no verifications checks on virtually all methods.If you want you may add them.
